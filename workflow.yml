TubeLearn Workflow
1. Installation
Before you can use tubelearn, you need to install it and its dependencies.

bash
Copy code
pip install tubelearn
2. Import tubelearn Functions
Import the relevant functions from tubelearn into your Python script or Jupyter Notebook.

python
Copy code
from tubelearn import text_link, url_grab, playlist_grab, play2text
3. Extract Transcripts from YouTube Videos
Option 1: Extract Transcripts from a List of Video URLs
If you have a list of YouTube video URLs in a text file, you can extract transcripts from all of them at once.

python
Copy code
# Provide the path to the text file containing video URLs
text_link('path_to_file.txt', name='output_folder_name')
Option 2: Extract Transcript from a Single Video URL
To extract the transcript from a single YouTube video URL:

python
Copy code
# Provide a single YouTube video URL
url_grab('video_url', name='output_folder_name')
Option 3: Extract Transcripts from a YouTube Playlist
If you want to extract transcripts from an entire YouTube playlist:

python
Copy code
# Provide the URL of a YouTube playlist
playlist_grab('playlist_url', name='output_folder_name')
4. Convert Playlist Video Links to Text File
You can also convert the video links from a YouTube playlist into a text file:

python
Copy code
# Provide the URL of a YouTube playlist
play2text('playlist_url')
5. Data Processing (Optional)
After extracting transcripts, you may want to perform further data processing or analysis on the obtained text data using various natural language processing (NLP) or machine learning techniques.

6. Conclusion
The tubelearn package streamlines the process of extracting and cleaning YouTube video transcripts, making it an invaluable tool for machine learning practitioners and researchers working on projects related to data preprocessing and dataset collection.

This workflow provides a high-level overview of how to use tubelearn to extract and process YouTube video transcripts. Users can adapt these steps according to their specific project requirements and workflows.
